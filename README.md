🔢 Just wrapped up Task 3 at CodSoft, and it was all about building a fully functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 💻🎉
This project challenged me to integrate all three languages seamlessly. HTML for structuring the calculator, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the logic that makes the calculations happen.
From responsive design to handling user inputs and implementing mathematical operations, every detail was meticulously crafted. The calculator is not just a set of buttons; it's a dynamic tool that enhances the user's experience.
Big thanks to CodSoft for the continuous support and resources that made this task an exciting and rewarding journey! 🙌🚀
Thrilled to showcase my calculator and ready for the next coding adventure ahead! ⚙️➕➖✖️➗ #webdevelopment #html #css #javascriptdeveloper #codsoft #calculatorproject #codingchallenge 💡💻
